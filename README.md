### Welcome to the Basic Git Tutorial

**BEFORE PROCEEDING**, if this is your first time working with git on your machine, it is recommended you go to the [git setup script repository](https://github.com/Bugatone/Git-Setup-Script) to help you configure your machine to properly work with git.

1. **Fork this repository** and bring it under your user to work on it. The fork button is on the top right corner of this page. Right under your user icon. After forking the project got to the fork's repository page under your user and continue working on this tutorial from there.

2. Git is a distributed version control system. So every time you start working on a project, you will need to clone it to your local machine. This is called cloning

  2.1 Go to your home directory, and run this command in your terminal.
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:Bugatone/Basic-Git-Tutorial.git git-tutorial
  ```
  
  **Congratulations!** You now have a local copy of the git repository you can work on.
  
3. Create a file and write something in it.

4. Add the file

5. Commit the file with a message

6. See the commit history with `git log`

7. Push your changes to the remote repository to share with your colleagues.

8. Create another file, write to it, `add`, and `commit`.

9. Remove the previous file with `git rm`, and `commit` the removal.

10. `push` the changes.

11. On GitHub, open your fork, and change 

- `git clone`
- `git status`
- `git add`
  - `git add .`
- `git commit`
- `git rm`
- `git log`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
